## Problems Encountered & Solutions

There were so many probelm during the part 2. So  many things went wrong such as the time was very limited as our finals finish just 2-3 days before the sumbission of the project. We know we should be better at our time management. 

1. During the attributes the attributes could not show up. We tried many was to slove it. 

2. The Alien movement was also has some problem. The alien did not move. But finally we did to do it. 

3.  The character turn also did not work. The character did not turn as command. Finally, solved!

4. We did not use class in Part 1, realise the importance of having class in the code, we added it in Part 2.

5. Some problem that encountered, we looked at Lab 8 and Lab 11 tutorial notes for reference and solution.

6. For the save game, many errors came out, we tried to solve it but did not have enough time

7. something went wrong in the zombie class in the last minute, so we decided to not include zombie to make the other code work.
