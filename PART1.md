## Minimum Requirements

Alien vs Zombie is a turn-based combat game in which the player controls Alien to defeat a group of Zombies. Prior to the game, the player can customize settings including game board dimensions and number of zombies. The player can also save a game into a file and load a game from a file.

The game is played on two-dimensional board that contains game characters and objects. No characters or objects can be placed outside the board.
The dimensions of the game board must be odd numbers so that the Alien can be placed at the centre of the game board.
For game board with 10 or more rows or columns, ensure that the row and column numbers are displayed correctly.

## Problems Encountered & Solutions

1. The very first problem we faced is the Game Board itself. The rows and colums are always printed wrong. The solution was simple, but we took a long time to solve it. 

2. Next with the default settings. Even though we put different number of rows and columns but it didn't print it. We had to change all functions in the int main() just so the program work correctly. 

3. The placement of Alien was not at centre. We had to use a function called centrecol and centrerow.
